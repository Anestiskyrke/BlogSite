                        <p class='card-text'>An abandoned citadel located on a nexus of ley lines in southern Deadwind Pass.
                        The tower is best known for its last known occupant — Medivh, the last Guardian of Tirisfal. 
                        After Medivh was killed by Khadgar, Lothar, and Garona, the tower sealed itself off from the rest of the world. 
                        But recently, Karazhan has reawakened — an evil presence has taken the tower as its own, its halls crawling with spirits and demons... and Medivh's presence is still alive and well, even decades after his death.
